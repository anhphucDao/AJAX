- Installed Android Toolchain
  - Install Android SDK
  - Install JDK 19
  - Accept all licenses
- Installed Android Studio, Flatpak version. Remember to set path with `flutter config --android-studio-dir=/var/lib/flatpak/app/com.google.AndroidStudio/current/active/files/extra/android-studio`
  - Flutter may be unable to find bundled Java version with Android Studio. The problem is that it looks for ${android-studio-dir}/jre but that folder may not even exist. The current workaround is to create jre as a softlink to jbr.
